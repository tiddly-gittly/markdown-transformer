## About

### Watch-FS

"linonetwo/watch-fs"

This plugin enables TiddlyWiki to watch the change in your disk, solves [pick up changes made by outside agencies #1530](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/1530), and if you edit one of your tiddler using editor likes VSCode and save it on the disk, the change will immediately reflected in the browser.

This by default monitor `./tiddlers` folder, if you have a different setup like my [linonetwo/wiki](https://github.com/linonetwo/wiki), add a `watchFolder` config to your `tiddlywiki.info`:

```json
{
  ...
  "themes": [
    "tiddlywiki/vanilla",
    "linonetwo/itonnote"
  ],
  ...
  "config": {
    "watchFolder": "./Meme-of-LinOnetwo/tiddlers"
  },
```

See [Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/3060](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/3060) for related discussions.
